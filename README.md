Science Education through Gamification, using the History of Math as main

## Motivation
"But pi's ubiquity goes beyond math. The number crops up in the natural world, too. It appears everywhere there's a circle, of course, such as the disk of the sun, the spiral of the DNA double helix, the pupil of the eye, the concentric rings that travel outward from splashes in ponds. Pi also appears in the physics that describes waves, such as ripples of light and sound. It even enters into the equation that defines how precisely we can know the state of the universe, known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle."

How different is this from: "Pi is the ratio of the circumference by its diamater"?

Science can be fun, VERY FUN! But we are missing the point, in every opportunity to learn, teach and share it.

Using gamification, we don't want to teach math or science. We want _every person in the world_ to re-create science from its own history of where it was needed. This is part of the educational nerve of the nway-project in which knowledge will be transfered using actual mechanisms instead of blind repetition.
